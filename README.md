# LD3PA: Language-Driven Perspective-based Pick-and-Place Algorithm

The source codes of our IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters paper.
Perspective ambiguity widely exists in human-robot interaction, especially in the language-driven robot manipulation. It is easy to place the object at a wrong position just because of different perspectives. Thus, placement location determination is required in language-driven robot manipulation. In this paper, we introduced a Language-Driven Perspective-based Pick-and-Place Algorithm (LD3PA) to solve this problem.
